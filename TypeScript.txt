Typescript

npm i -g typescript
 to install typescript globally use git bash

tsc --version
 turns thing from typescript into javascript

typescript may be useful information if going to work for kroger

packages need to be installed in order to run the application,
especially when pushing and pulling from github
npm install in the root folder

using typescript you can apply a type to these,
greg wants us to always do this while using typescript
(a: number)
variables properties and parameters
add = (a:n, b:n):n 
    says it adds numbers together, and returns a number
when using typescript the web wont be able to read it,
so you have to turn it into a js file so it can be read
in terminal, cd into js, and do tsc index.ts, creates js version of ts

tsc --init loads tsconfig.json file
to make js from ts show up in another folder, allow outDir in tsconfig.json
to root to "./js", and then insert "include": ["./ts/**/*.ts"] after 2nd closing brace
and then insert tsc into terminal to run command and js will be loaded into js folder

tsc -w sets a watch so it changes globally, kind of like html to a web browser going live
ctrl c in the terminal brings back gitbash
